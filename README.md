# Android-Programming

## Introduction 

For teaching you the value of hard work, for inspiring and encouraging me to pursue a career in computing 
It was polished enough to be presentable and give us many invaluable suggestions and corrections, with such a talented and entertaining crew 
Sanding away the remaining rough edges of this 
You face a steep learning curve 
It helps to have a guide through unfamiliar territory 



## Prequisite 
When there are rough spots, or when some things are tricky or obscure, you will face them head on 
If the concepts do not ring a bell, you will be in the weeds.
We will provide some brief reminder about java specifics 

It is goal is to get you over the initial hump to where you can get the most out of the reference. Added on unit testing, accessibility, the MVVM architectural style, and localization. 
Going off the beaten path and finding your way will solidify your learning and give you confidence 
Typographical conventions for all widely used version . there is a small amount of market share on older versions .keep track of the latest one 


## Convention

There are two areas where our choices differ from what you might see elsewhere 
1 We use anonymous inner classes for listeners. This is mostly a matter of opinion. We find it makes for cleaner code in the app because it puts the listenerâ€™s method implementation right where you want to see them 
In high-performance contexts or large applications, anonymous inner classes may cause problems, but for most circumstances , they work fine 

2 Fragments , we use them for user interface. 
Fragments are not an absolutely necessary tool, but we find that, when used correctly, they are a valuable tool in any toolkit. 
They are not that difficult to work with. 
Fragments have clear advantages over activities that make them worth the effort, including flexibility in building and presenting your user interface 

Android studio is an integrated development environment used for it that is based off the popular tool is under active development 
The emulator is useful for testing apps. However, it is no substitute for an actual device when measuring performance 





### Part1 
#### 1 your first android app 
It is full of new concepts and moving parts required to build an app , the app tests the user;s knowledge of geography 




#### An activity is an instance of Activity, a class in the android SDK. An activity is responsible for managing user interaction with a screen of information 
You write subclass of Activity to implement the functionality that your app requires. 
A simple application may need only one subclass; a complex application can have many 


#### A layout defines a set of UI objects and their positions on the screen. A layout is made up of definition written in XML. Each definition is used to create an object that appears on screen.
