# Android-Programming


## Introduction 
there are some rough spots, a steep learning curve, you will be in weed, a little rusty getting your head around. This requires leanring new ideas and techniques, have a guide through unfamiliar territory lead you through several applications 
learn into pratices right away, ring a bell, brief reminderes 


this repository is to get you over the initial hump to where you can get the most out of the reference and recipe 

going off the beaten path and finding your way will soify your learning and give you confidence with your projects 
differ from what you might see elsewhere with typographical conventions for widely used versions 
revisiting these ideas in greater detail as you proceed through the course of development 


## 1 First Android Application 



Concepts : 
##### an activity is an instance of Activity, a class in the Android SDK, an activity is responsible for managing user interaction with a screen of information 
##### You write subclasses of Activity to implement the functionality that your app requires. A simple application may need only one subclass; a complex application can have many.


##### A layout defines a set of UI objects and their positions on the screen. A layout is made up of definitions written in XML. Each definition is used to create an object that appears on screen, like a button or some text.
