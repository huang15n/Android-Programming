## Learning Android 
you face a steep learning curve. even if you speak the language, it will not feel like home home first 
android speaks Java,but knowing java is not enough. getting your head around it reqiures many new ideas and techniques. it helps to have a guide through unfamiliar territory 
we will lead you through writting several application, introducing concepts and techniques as needed

when thre are rough spots, or when thigns are obscure, you will face them head on, and we will do our best to explain why things are te way they are 

this approach allows you to put what you ahve learned into practice in a working app right away rather than learning a lot of theory and then having to figure out how to apply it 

toward the end of the repository, we have added material on challanges 

this is not a reference repository. its goal is to get you over the initl bump to where you can get the most out of the recipe books available 
as such, it is meant to be worked through from the beginning. 
give your direct experience using them 

# Prequisites 
you need to be familiar with java, include classes and objects, interface, listeners, packages , inner classes, annoymous inner classes, and generic classes 
if these concepts o not ring a bell, you will be in the weeds 
start instead with an introducotry java, and return to this afterward 
we will provide some brief reimders about java specifics like interface and annoymous inner classe 




we are thankful that she was there to impose focus, precision, and clarity on our draft 
thank you for sanding away the remaning rough edges of this repo 
there is a feedback loop between me and them. 
for inspiring and encouraging me to pursue a career in computing. for cheering me on through all the ups anddowns and for reminding methat wawtching it makes things better 

they are shephereded into existence by a community of collaborators, risk takers and other supporters, witout whom the burden of comphrending and writing all this material would be cripping 


our fantastically talented and soft-spoken designer 
unbeknownst to us, he went hehind our backs and update the nifty cheat sheet you can find attached to this repo 

he, who reviewed our coverage for accuracy and wonderfulness. 

as a practical matter, it is not possible to do this work without him. he always wrote by cutting up his work into little pieces, throwing them in the air, and publishing the rearrangement. 
our confusion and simpleminded excitement may have caused us to restort to such techniques 


# code style 
there are two areas where our choices differ from what you might see whereelse in the comunity 
#### disregard this if you are not familiar with Java 
### we use anoymous inner classes for listeners : this is mostly a matter of opionn we find it maks for cleaner code in the app because it puts the listener's method implementations rihgt wehrer you want to see them. in high perforance contexts to large apps, annoymous inner classes may cuase problems but for most circumstances they work fine 
### we use fragments for all user interface. fragments are not an absoluetly necessary tool, when used correctly, they are a valuable too in any toolkit. fragments have clear advanages over activities that make them worth the effort, inclduing flexibility in building and presenting your user intfaces 


as of this writing, it is under active development and is frequently updated.
